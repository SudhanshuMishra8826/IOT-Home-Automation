# IOT-Home-Automation
This was part of a project based on using Arduino and DHT sensor to detect temperature and humidity and turning on various devices accordingly. Here we have used led and servo as indicator for various temperature ranges.

#### Components used in this project

- Servo Motor
- 3 LEDs (Red, Green and Yellow)
- DHT11 Sensor

#### Pins Used for each component

- Servo is connected to pin 11
- DHT11 is connected to pin 10
- 3 LEDs are connected to pins 2, 5, 7 respectively
